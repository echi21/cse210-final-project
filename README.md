# Final Project: Soccer bomb
Are you good at running while being persecuted? Find out with this incredible
arcade game version of soccer. The goal is simple. You need to run and make
contact with the soccer goal. Each time you do that, you gain points. In the
meantime, eleven enemy players will follow you, and if they touch you, you will
not score. Mmm, just one more comment: the enemy players are not normal players.
If they reach you, you will explode and the game is over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.9.8 or slightly previous version (it will not work
with python 3.10) and arcade 2.6.5 or previous version, installed and running on
your machine. You can install Arcade by opening a terminal and running the
following command.
```
python3 -m pip install arcade
or
pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse inside
to the project's root folder called project. Start the program by running the
following command.
```
python __main__.py 
```
You can also run the program from a Code Editor like Visual Studio Code or an IDE
like Pycharm. Start your IDE and open the project. Select the main module
inside the 'project' folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- project             (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
    +-- images          (specific game images)
    +-- sound_effects   (specific game sounds)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
