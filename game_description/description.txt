What program are we going to create?
	"Soccerbomb": An arcade game where you control a player at the left side of the screen who needs
	to move and go to the right side. Enemy players will be moving, trying to touch the player; if they
	do it, it is game over (hopefully with explosions). The game's purpose is to make the player reach
	the goal (which will be at the edge of the right side of the screen).

What technologies will we use?
	We will use python 3.9 version and the arcade library.

What features will we include?
	We believe we will include the following features:

	Main Scene 
	• Play button.
	• Extra (if there is time): Exit button.
	
	Game Scene 
	• User-controlled player.
	• Enemy players.
	• Collision detection.
	• Extra (if there is time): Score display, life display, pause, and sound effects.

	Help Scene 
	• Extra (if there is time): Instructions text.

	Win Scene 
	• Announcement.

	Lose Scene 
	• Announcement.
	• Extra (if there is time): Restart button.

What is your timeline?
	Our timeline is specified in the course. We will be working on this program for 4 weeks
	submitting the advances each week according to the instructions, and the deadline will
	probably between 9 to 11 on December.
